#Ensure that your server 

#(python -m http.server 8080) remains running in the 

#~/Jim_Antivirus/static 

#directory whenever you run the antivirus script#python 

#~/Jim_Antivirus/antivirus.py
#python -m http.server 8080

#Ensure that your server (python -m http.server 8080) remains running in the ~/Jim_Antivirus/static directory whenever you run the antivirus script.
#To set up and run your antivirus project on your Android device using Termux, follow these steps:
#1. Verify Directory Structure
#Ensure your project directory structure is correct:

#bash
#Copy code
#~/Jim_Antivirus
#|-- antivirus.py
#|-- app.py
#|-- env
#|-- file-5.45
#|-- hello-ngrok
#|-- name_file
#|-- static
#|   |-- virus_definitions.txt
#|-- templates
#2. Check virus_definitions.txt
#Ensure virus_definitions.txt contains your virus #signatures:

#bash
#Copy code
#~/Jim_Antivirus/static/virus_definitions.txt
#Example contents:

#text
#Copy code
#known_virus_hash_1
#known_virus_hash_2
#3. Update Hosts File
#Your /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/etc/hosts should include the following entry:

#text
#Copy code
#10.123.146.215    Jim
#You’ve already confirmed this step.

#4. Start the HTTP Server
#Navigate to the static directory and start the HT#TP server:

#bash
#Copy code
#cd ~/Jim_Antivirus/static
#python -m http.server 8080
#Ensure this server remains running in one terminal window.

#5. Run the Antivirus Script
#Open another terminal window or a new session in Termux, and run your updated antivirus.py script:

#bash
#Copy code
#python ~/Jim_Antivirus/antivirus.py
#6. Interact with the Antivirus Script
#The script should display a banner and prompt you to enter file paths to scan. Here’s how it should work step-by-step:

#Start the Script:

#bash
#Copy code
#python ~/Jim_Antivirus/antivirus.py
#You should see the "JIM ANTIVIRUS" banner.

#Update Virus Definitions:
#The script will attempt to fetch virus definitions from http://Jim:8080/virus_definitions.txt.

#Scan Files:
#The script will prompt you to enter the file path to scan. Enter the path of the file you want to scan or type 'q' to quit.

#Example Workflow:
#Starting the HTTP Server:

#bash
#Copy code
#cd ~/Jim_Antivirus/static
#python -m http.server 8080
#Running the Antivirus Script:

#Open another Termux session:

#bash
#Copy code
#python ~/Jim_Antivirus/antivirus.py
#You should see the "JIM ANTIVIRUS" banner.
#The script will attempt to fetch virus definitions from the running HTTP server.
#It will prompt you for a file path to scan.
#Scanning a File:

#When prompted, enter the file path:

#text
#Copy code
#Enter the file path to scan (or 'q' to quit):
#/path/to/your/file
#The script will identify the file type, check for virus signatures, and display the result.

#Debugging Tips:
#Ensure the HTTP server remains running while the antivirus script is being executed.
#If you encounter issues, check the URL directly in a web browser or using curl to ensure the server is accessible.
#Double-check the IP address and port number used in the URL.
#By following these steps, you should be able to set up and run your antivirus project successfully on your Android device using Termux.
